This is an example project of FRC Java code for new team members.

Installation
------------

To get this project, and future projects, in Eclipse do the following (these instructions assume you have Eclipse along with the FRC plugins, if not go here: http://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/4485/m/13809/l/145002-installing-eclipse-c-java)  
0.	**Get EGit!**  
Yes step zero, things are zero-indexed get used to it (just remember less than not less than or equal to, seriously, you will make this mistake a million times). To get EGit follow the instructions given [here](http://eclipse.org/egit/download/).  
1.	**Get the URL**  
In order to get the project we need to download it from github and we do so by getting a URL. The URL for this repository is given on GitHub (the white box that says `HTTPS clone URL`) this needs to copied to our clipboard.  
2.	**Clone the Project**  
Now we need to clone the project to our hard disk. In Eclipse go to File>Import then in the window select the `Git` folder, and then `Project from Git`. Now select `Clone URI`. In the box for a URI paste the URL we copied in the previous step.  
3. 	**After that, branches and wizards**  
Select the `master` branch (or the branch that you should be working on). Hit Next, and select a place for your project to be saved to. Hit Next, and *most importantly*, please, check the box next to `Import as general project` for your wizard (this might be subject to change depending upon if the IDE-independence philosophy is kept.) hit Next, choose a good project name for yourself, and hit Finish. You are all set! :octocat:
